To run the analysis, download the main raw data file "20CopyrighCaseSequences.csv" and associated data file "ROC.csv", open R, and run the code found in the file "CopyrightPMI.R" (editing it appropriately to match your appropriate working directory). This will produce the output file "PMI.csv", but this file is also included here for completeness.
